This project visualizes the process of reversing a singly and doubly linked list using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The visualization includes a step-by-step explanation of each operation performed during the reversal.

## Features

- Visual representation of singly and doubly linked lists
- Step-by-step explanation of the reversal process
- Color-coded nodes to indicate current operations
- Smooth transitions and animations for node movements

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Click the "Reverse Singly Linked List" button to visualize the reversal of a singly linked list.
3. Click the "Reverse Doubly Linked List" button to visualize the reversal of a doubly linked list.
4. Follow the explanations provided to understand the reversal process.

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the page.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling the page.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file for handling the logic and animations.

## Acknowledgements

This project serves as a demonstration of how a linked list reversal can be visualized. It is intended for educational purposes and may have room for improvements in terms of design and functionality.
